# e-commerce_api

A full-stack e-commerce application from scratch. I use Java and the Spring Boot environment to create a robust backend 
supporting payments with the Stripe API. I used Java and Spring Boot to build the application's RESTful API and connect it to a MySQL database. 
The API enabled users to browse and search for products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. 
Implemented features such as payment processing using Stripe, order history tracking, authentication and authorization. Utilized Hibernate for data persistence.
